# Assessing Tornado Damage Using Computer Vision 

This project was done for the Spring '25 Computer Vision Course at UNCC 

## Introduction
The F/EF Scale has long been utilized to predict what the minimum wind speeds of a tornado were during tornado damage assesment. This project aims to utilize tornado damage images and the degrees of damage found within them to help assess the EF rating of a tornado. Final outcome is for an image to be submitted and then out put with the degree of damage and if there are multiple images to assess most of the damage produced by the tornado, then also provide a preliminary EF rating. This is in hopes of helping lowe 

## Data
Exporting data from the National Weather Services Damage Assessment Toolkit will provide the data on the tornado, the degrees of damage found in certain areas and the images within them along with the EF rating at the time based on the damage.

## Methods


## Results
